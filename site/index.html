          I have also worked for Konecranes for six years. I have been a buyer
          in Agilon product line, being responsible for rating suppliers and
          placing purchase orders. Before this, my title was Quality Engineer in
          Hyvinkää electrical component factory, providing warranty period
          deliveries and customer service for internal departments. I'm familiar
          with various SAP modules: sales orders, invoicing and purchase orders,
          and also light experience in warehouse transactions.
